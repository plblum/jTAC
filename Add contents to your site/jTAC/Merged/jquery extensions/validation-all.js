Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.Base       ABSTRACT CLASS
Extends: None

Purpose:
Condition classes evaluate something about your page and return "success", "failed", 
or "cannot evaluate". They are the underlying tool used by input validators, but lack
a lot of extras used by validation because Conditions appear in many situations other than validation.

Effectively Condition objects let you create IF THEN logic in your javascript
evaluating information about the page, without you having to worry about
details like getting the value from an input element, converting it into a date or number,
or applying a regular expression to it.

A Condition object does not contain any UI, unlike validators.
A validator needs an error message to show in the UI and a mechanism
to display it (such as showing an alert or inserting it in a <span> tag).

A library of Condition objects supports many common real-world cases.
You can also create Condition objects for your special cases.
Once created, they can be plugged into validation or used in other situations that need
IF THEN logic.

Essential Methods:
   canEvaluate() - Returns true if the Condition is enabled and ready to evaluate data.
   evaluate() - Evaluates and returns one of these results: 1 = success, 0 = failed, -1 = cannot evaluate.
      Internally it calls upon another method, _evaluateRule, which the subclass
      implements to handle the condition's rule.
   isValid() - A variation of the evaluate() function that returns a boolean.
      When true, the condition evaluates as success or cannot evaluate.
      When false, it evaluates as failed.

Essential properties:
   enabled (boolean) - When false, evaluate should not be called. canEvaluate() uses it. Defaults to true.
   typeManager (TypeManager object) - Used when the condition needs 
      to convert a string to another type, like number or date. Assign
      the TypeManager subclass that handles the conversion.
   datatype (string) - When using the typeManager, this is the name associated with the typemanager.
      When not using the typeManager, this is null. Setting it will always update the typeManager property.
   not (boolean) - When true, apply a NOT operator to the result of evaluation,
      so "success" = 0 and "failed" = 1. ("Cannot evaluate" stays -1). 
   trim (boolean) - When true (the default), string values are trimmed before evaluating.
   lastEvaluateResult (int) - Indicates the value from the last time the Evaluate() method was run.
      If it has not been run, it is null.
   name (string) - Gets a string that gives the class a unique name.
   autoDisable (boolean) - Determines if a connection that is attached to a non-editable widget
      causes this condition to disable itself by returning false in
      its canEvaluate() method.
      When true, connections are checked. If any return false in their isEditable()
      method, canEvalaute() will return false.
      When false, connections are not checked.
      It defaults to true.

/*
Creates a Condition object and evaluates it through its evaluate() method.
It returns 1 = success; 0 = failed; and -1 = cannot evaluate.

Use this function when you want an instant evaluation without having
to keep a Condition around.

The json parameter describes properties to set on the object, and also 
identifies the class of the initial object. 
While the json parameter works well with a real JavaScript Object Notable object,
you can pass in an ordinary object. That allows you to pass code in as parameters.
For example, you can pass a javascript Date object to the [minimum] and [maximum] 
properties of the Conditions.Range instead of passing a string that gets
converted into a date.

The class of the Condition object is defined by the jtacClass property in the JSon object, 
such as:
{ "jtacClass" : "Conditions.CompareToValue", "elementId" : "TextBox1", "valueToCompare" : 10, "operator" : "<" }
This case creates a Conditions.CompareToValue that compares two integer values.
If you want to compare another type, specify the typeManager property with 
its value being a JSon object with its own jtacClass property defining the appropriate
TypeManager class. For example:
{ "jtacClass" : "Conditions.CompareToValue", "elementId" : "DateTextBox1", "valueToCompare" : "2000-01-01", "operator" : "<",
   "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "TypeManagers.Date" } 
}
You can also use non-Json syntax to create the typeManager object in code.
{ "jtacClass" : "Conditions.CompareToValue", "elementId" : "DateTextBox1", "valueToCompare" : "2000-01-01", "operator" : "<",
   "typeManager" : jTAC.create("TypeManagers.Date") } 
}

See \jTAC\TypeManagers\Base.js for more on TypeManagers.

Always ensure that any Connection properties are correctly setup.
Connections point to the form elements or other widgets, usually by setting their [id]
property. Typically you just set the [elementId] and [elementId2] properties on the Condition
and they setup the Connection for you, such as shown above.

You can replace the default Connection object by defining its property in json
and using json for the value. That json must indicate the jsclsas property
to specify the name of the Connection class.
In this example, the Conditions.CompareToValue is comparing dates, and has replaced
the default Connection (which uses elementId : "DateTextBox1") with 
a Connections.Value.
{ "class" : "Conditions.CompareToValue", 
   "connection" : { "jtacClass" : "Connections.Value", "value" : "05/31/1965" },
   "valueToCompare" : "01/01/2000", "operator" : "<",
   "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "TypeManagers.Date" } 
}

See \jTAC\Connections\Base.js for more on Connections.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.BaseOneOrMoreConnections     ABSTRACT CLASS
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneConnection

Purpose:
Abstract base class that supports one or more Connections to elements
on the page. If you only have one Connection, it can use the [elementId]
or [connection] property. For any more, add an array of connections to the
[moreConnections] property.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   moreConnections (array) - 
      Use when there are more than one Connection. The first connection always
      goes in the 'connection' property. The rest in moreConnections.
      Create the Connection.BaseElement subclass that works with the widget
      and use the push() method on the array to add it to the end of the array.

   ignoreNotEditable (boolean) -
      When there are two or more connections used, this determines
      if elements that are not editable are counted.
      For example, when Mode = All and there is one non-editable connection,
      "All" means one less than the total connections.
      When true, not editable connections are not counted.
      When false, they are.
      It defaults to false.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.BaseCounter      ABSTRACT CLASS
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneOrMoreConnections

Purpose:
One or more Connections are evaluated to total something about the value
of each, such as number of characters, words, or selected items. That total is compared
to a range defined by minimum and maximum.

Subclass overriding the _connCount() function. It should evaluate the connection passed in
to return a number that is added to the total by the caller.

Set up:
   For the first Connection, set the widget's id in the [elementId] property or modify
   the Connection object in its [connection] property.
   For additional connections, create Connection objects like Connection.FormElement.
   Add them to [moreConnections] property, which is an array
   by using the array's push() method.


See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   minimum (integer)  -
      Determines the minimum of the count to report "success".
      If null, it is not used. Otherwise it must be a positive integer.
   
   maximum (integer)
      Determines the maximum of the count to report "success".
      If null, it is not used. Otherwise it must be a positive integer.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.Required
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneOrMoreConnections

Purpose:
One or more elements are evaluated to see if its value is not unassigned, empty, or null. 
You can evaluate the value of it to any widget: textbox, list, checkbox, radio, calendar widget, etc.

Evaluation rules:
   Uses the Connection class’ isNullValue() method to determine if the element has data or not.
   With just one Connection, it returns “success” when the element’s value 
   has been assigned and “failed” and it is unassigned.
   With more than one Connection, it uses the [mode] property to count the number of elements 
   that have their values assigned. It returns “success” if the number of elements matches 
   the mode property rule and “failed” when it does not.

Set up:
   For the first element, set the widget's id in the [elementId] property.

   For additional elements, add their ids to the [moreConnections] property, 
   which is an array. Use either its push() method or assign an array of ids. 
   Then assign the [mode] property to determine how to evaluate multiple elements. 
   mode has these values: “All”, “OneOrMore”, “AllOrNone”, “One”, and “Range”. 
   If using “Range”, also set the [minimum] and [maximum] properties.

   When working with textual or list widgets, a value of the empty string is 
   normally considered unassigned. However, when a textbox has a watermark or 
   a list has its first item as "No Selection", specify the text of the watermark or 
   value of the first item in the Connection's [unassigned] property.
   For example, a list has an option with the label "No selection" and value of "NONE".
      var cond = jTAC.create("Required", {elementId: "ListBox1"});
      cond.connection.unassigned = "NONE";

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   mode (string) -
      When there are multiple connections, this is used to determine how many
      must be not null to report "success". Here are the mode values:
         "All" - All must have text
         "OneOrMore" - At least one must have text. This is the default.
         "AllOrNone" - All or none must have text
         "One" - Only one must have text
         "Range" - Specify the minimum and maximum number of widgets in this Condition's
            [minimum] and [maximum] properties.

   minimum (integer) and maximum (integer) -
      When [mode] = "Range", use these to determine the number of connections
      with values that are not null to report "success".

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.Range
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneConnection

Purpose:
Compares the value from an element on the page
to a range established by the properties.

Evaluation rules:
   Returns “success” when the value is within the range.
   Returns “failed” when the value is outside the range.
   Returns “cannot evaluate” when the element’s value cannot be converted into the native type.

Set up:
   Assign the element’s id to the [elementId] property. 

   Assign the range with the [minimum] and [maximum] properties. 
   This property can take native types, like a number or Date object. 
   It also can take strings that it converts to the native type, 
   so long as you use the culture neutral format for that data type.

   The TypeManager is normally identified by adding either [data-jtac-datatype] or 
   [data-jtac-typemanager] attributes to the element. If that is not done, 
   you can use the [datatype] or [typeManager] property to define the TypeManager.

   The TypeManager also has [minValue] and [maxValue] properties when you include 
   the jquery-ui widgets\Command extensions.js file or Merged\TypeManagers\datatypeeditor.js file.
    
   The Conditions.Range object will use those properties if its own minimum and maximum are null.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   minimum - The minimum value. If null, not evaluated.
      A string or any value that is compatible with the TypeManager.
      If it is a string, its format must be culture neutral.
      Integers: [-]digits
      Float, Currency, Percent: [-]digits.digits  (always has at least one decimal place)
      Date: yyyy-MM-dd
      TimeOfDay and Duration: H:mm:ss
      DateTime: yyyy-MM-dd H:mm:ss
      DayMonth: MM-dd
      MonthYear: yyyy-MM

   maximum - The maximum value. If null, not evaluated.
      A string or any value that is compatible with the TypeManager.
      If it is a string, its format must be culture neutral.

   lessThanMax (boolean) - When true, evaluate less than the maximum.
      When false, evaluate less than or equals the maximum.
      Defaults to false.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.CompareToValue
Extends: Conditions.BaseOperator

Purpose:
Compares the value from a form element or widget
to a fixed value declared in the [valueToCompare] property. 
Use the [operator] property to define the comparison.

Evaluation rules:
   Returns “success” when the values compare according to the operator.
   Returns “failed” when the values do not compare correctly.
   Returns “cannot evaluate” when the element’s value cannot be converted into the native type.

Set up:
   Assign the id of the element to the [elementId] property.

   Assign the value to compare to the [valueToCompare] property. This property can take native types, 
   like a number or Date object. It also can take strings that it converts to the native type, 
   so long as you use the culture neutral format for that data type.

   Use the [operator] property to define the comparison with one of these strings: 
   “=”, “<>”, “<”, “>”, “<=”, “>=”.

   The TypeManager is normally identified by adding either [data-jtac-datatype] or 
   [data-jtac-typemanager] attributes to the element. If that is not done, 
   you can use the [datatype] or [typeManager] property to define the TypeManager.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.BaseRegExp
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneConnection

Purpose:
A base class for developing Conditions using a regular expression 
to evaluate the text in the connection property.
Subclasses must override _getExpression() to supply the expression. 
Optionally override _getCaseIns() and _getGlobal() to supply those regex flags.

This base class provides a framework for creating many expression generator
Conditions. This lets the user avoid trying to create the appropriate
expression for some common cases because those child Conditions
will let the user set rules (as properties) and the Condition's
_getExpression() method will generate the correct expression.
These child conditions make it easier to identify the business rule being
described. You don't have to analyze the regular expression, just 
look at the name of the condition class and its properties.

RECOMMENDATION: Create a TypeManager instead of a Condition when the regular
expression is always used to represent a specific data type.
TypeManagers are the preferred way to evaluate data types. The user
can then use the Condition.DataTypeCheck with it.
They can also use the TypeManager with the jquery-ui dataTypeEditor widget.
Result: Handles more cases and eliminates creating a validation rule for the new condition.

Evaluation rules:
When the text is matched by the regular expression, it evaluates as "success".
Otherwise it evaluates as "failed".
When the text is the empty string, evaluates as "cannot evaluate"
so long as [ignoreBlankText] is true.
If you want to reverse this logic, set the not property to true.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   ignoreBlankText (boolean) -
      Determines how blank text is evaluated. 
      When true, the condition cannot be evaluated.
      When false, the condition evaluates as failed (reports an error). 
      It defaults to true.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.RegExp
Extends: Conditions.BaseRegExp

Purpose:
Use a regular expression to evaluate the text in the [connection] property.
This class allows the user to define the expression explicitly
in its [expression] property. There may be other Conditions that also 
generate the correct expression for a given business rule. Consider
using them as they better document the rule and are often an easier 
way to define the correct expression.

Evaluation rules:
   When the text is matched by the regular expression, it evaluates as "success".
   Otherwise it evaluates as "failed".
   When the text is the empty string, evaluates as "cannot evaluate"
   so long as [ignoreBlankText] is true.
   If you want to reverse this logic, set the not property to true.

Set up:
   Assign the element’s id to the [elementId] property. 

   Develop a regular expression and assign it to the [expression] property.

   Regular expressions have options which you can set with the 
   [caseIns], [global], and [multiline] properties.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   expression (string) -
      A valid regular expression pattern.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.Difference
Extends: Conditions.BaseOperator

Purpose:
Compares the difference between two values to another number
in the [differenceValue] property.
The [operator] property defines the comparison rule. 

Evaluation rules:
   Returns “success” when the values compare according to the operator.
   Returns “failed” when the values do not compare correctly.
   Returns “cannot evaluate” when either of the element’s values cannot be converted into the native type.

Set up:
   Assign one element’s id to the [elementId] property and the other to the [elementId2] property. 
   These two will have their values calculated as Math.abs(elementId – elementId2). 
   The result is compared to the value of [differenceValue]. Assign a number to [differenceValue]
   and an [operator] to determine how the elements are compared to [differenceValue].

   The TypeManager is normally identified by adding either [data-jtac-datatype] or [data-jtac-typemanager] 
   attributes to the element. If that is not done, you can use the [datatype] or [typeManager] property 
   to define the TypeManager.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   differenceValue - The value to compare on the right side of the 
      operator. ((connection - connection2) operator differenceValue) 
      Must be a number. Can be integer or float.
      How this is used depends on the TypeManager's toNumber() method.
      For example, DateTypeManager expects this to be a number of days.
      Defaults to 1.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.RequiredIndex
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneConnection

Purpose:
Ensures that there is a selected item in a list type widget by evaluating the 
state of its [unassignedIndex] property.

While often lists have a value="" representing no selection, many developers 
prefer to add a "---NO SELECTION--" item. As a result, sometimes "no selection" 
means selectedIndex = 0 and other times it means selectedIndex = -1. 
Therefore, the user can specify which they are using in the unassignedIndex property.

Note: The Conditions.Required class can also be used to evaluate a list, 
but evaluates the textual value, not the selected index.

Evaluation rules:
   When the index specified in [unassignedIndex] matches the selected index, it means "failed".
   Any other index means "success".
   If you want to reverse this logic, set the not property to true.

Set up:
   Assign the list element’s id to the [elementId] property.

   The [unassignedIndex] property defaults to 0, so it is correctly setup 
   if you have a “no selection” item first in the list. If you do not, 
   assign the [unassignedIndex] property. Set it to -1 if it is unassigned by having no selection.


See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   unassignedIndex (int) -
      The index value that when selected, indicates that the list has no selection.
      It is typically 0 (when the first item is for "no selection") or -1
      (when any selected index indicates a selection.)
      It defaults to 0.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.SelectedIndex
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneConnection

Purpose:
Compares an index specified in the [index] property with 
the actual selected index. The [index] property can also
supply an array of indices to match, including
ranges, like this: [1, 2, [10, 20]]
Each item in the array is an integer of an index to match.
If a range is needed, the item should be an array with to items,
a start and end index.

Supports both single selection and multiselection lists.

Evaluation rules:
When the index specified in [index] matches a selected index, it means "success".
Any other index means "failed".
If you want to reverse this logic, set the "not" property to true.


See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   index (integer or array) -
      The index value to match against the selected indices of the list.
      The value can either be an integer or an array.
      When it is an array, each item either an index number
      or an array representing a range. A range's array
      has two elements, start index and end index.
      It defaults to null.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.BooleanLogic
Extends: Conditions.Base

Purpose:
Defines an AND or OR expression using other Conditions.
For example, RequiredCondition on TextBox1 OR CompareToValueCondition on DecimalTextBox1.
You create Condition objects and add them to the [conditions] property.
Then set the [operator] property to "AND" or "OR".
You can use any type of Condition object including Conditions.BooleanLogic,
which means you can have child boolean expressions.

Evaluation rules:
   If using an AND operator, all child Conditions must evaluate as "success" for this condition to return "success".
   If using an OR operator, at least one child Condition must evaluate as "success" for this condition to return "success".
   If not, it returns "failed".
   If a child Condition returns false from canEvaluate() or returns "cannot evaluate" from evaluate(),
   it is excluded from evaluation. If all child Conditions are excluded, Conditions.BooleanLogic
   returns "cannot evaluate".

Set up:
   Create Condition objects and add them to the [conditions] property. 
   Then set the [operator] property to "AND" or "OR".

   If you want to switch operators, add a Conditions.BooleanLogic with its operator 
   set differently and populate its own [conditions] property to apply against its operator.

   Use the [not] property if you want to reverse the result.

Example to evaluate the following expression:
TextBox1 is required AND (((TextBox2 holds integer) AND (TextBox2 is in range 1 to 10)) OR ((TextBox3 holds integer) AND (TextBox3 is in range 1 to 10)))

Conditions.BooleanLogic  operator="AND" with these child conditions:
   Conditions.Required elementId="TextBox1"
   Conditions.BooleanLogic operator="OR" with these child conditions:
      Conditions.BooleanLogic operator="AND" with these child conditions:
         Conditions.DataTypeCheck elementId="TextBox2" datatype="Integer"
         Conditions.Range elementId="TextBox2" datatype="Integer" minimum=1 maximum=10
      Conditions.BooleanLogic operator="AND" with these child conditions:
         Conditions.DataTypeCheck elementId="TextBox3" datatype="Integer"
         Conditions.Range elementId="TextBox3" datatype="Integer" minimum=1 maximum=10

Here is the above logic represented in JSon:
{"jtacClass" : "BooleanLogic", "operator": "AND", 
  "conditions": [
    {"jtacClass": "Required", "elementId" : "TextBox1" },
    {"jtacClass" : "BooleanLogic", "operator": "OR", 
     "conditions": [
      { "jtacClass" : "BooleanLogic", "operator": "AND", 
        "conditions": [
         {"jtacClass" : "DataTypeCheck", "elementId" : "TextBox2" },
         {"jtacClass" : "Range", "elementId" : "TextBox2", "minimum" : 1, "maximum": 10 }
        ] },
      {"jtacClass" : "BooleanLogic", "operator": "AND", 
        "conditions": [
         {"jtacClass" : "DataTypeCheck", "elementId" : "TextBox3" },
         {"jtacClass" : "Range", "elementId" : "TextBox3", "minimum" : 1, "maximum": 10 }
        ] }
      ] }
 ] }


See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   operator (string) -
      Determines the boolean operator. Only allows "AND", "OR".
      Defaults to "OR".

   conditions (array of Condition objects) - 
      Add any Condition object that defines elements of the logic
      between each AND or OR operator. If you want to switch
      operators, add a Conditions.BooleanLogic with its operator set
      differently and its child Condition classes to apply against its own operator.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.DuplicateEntry
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneOrMoreConnections

Purpose:
Ensures that the list of elements on the page have different values.

If you are comparing list type widgets, it compares their textual values, 
not their index or the text shown the user.

Evaluation rules:
   If a pair is found to have the same string value, it evaluates as "failed".
   Otherwise it evaluates as "success".

Set up:
   For the first Connection, set the widget's id in the [elementId] property.

   For additional Connections, add their ids to the [moreConnections] property, 
   which is an array. Use either its push() method or assign an array of ids.

   Determine if comparisons are case insensitive with [caseIns] and if unassigned 
   fields are included with [ignoreUnassigned].


See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   caseIns (boolean) -
      When true, strings are compared using a case insensitive match.
      It defaults to true.

   ignoreUnassigned (boolean) - 
      When true, if the element's value is unassigned, it is never matched. 
      When false, the element's value is always used, even when blank. 
      It defaults to true.

Module: Condition objects
Class : Conditions.UserFunction
Extends: Conditions.BaseOneOrMoreConnections

Purpose:
Lets the user assign a function to do the work of the _evaluateRule() method.
Your function will be passed the instance of the Condition so it can
access all of its Connections and any properties assigned by the user.
It returns a value of 1 ("success"), 0 ("failed"), and -1 ("cannot evaluate").

Examples:
function IsVisible(cond) {
   // check if the first Connection is a visible DOM element
   var conn = cond.connection;
   if (!conn || !conn.getElement(true))   // nothing to evaluate
      return -1; // cannot evaluate
   return conn.isVisible() ? 1 : 0;

}

function MatchClassName(cond) {
   // check if the first Connection's class name is the value of 
   // cond.options.ClassName which is a custom property you defined.
   if (cond.options.ClassName === undefined)
      return -1;  // cannot evaluate
   var conn = cond.connection;
   if (!conn || !conn.getElement(true))   // nothing to evaluate
      return -1; // cannot evaluate
   return conn.getClass() == cond.options.ClassName ? 1 : 0;
}

Set up:
   Assign the element’s id to the [elementId] property and any additional
   elements to the [moreConnections] property. You can also omit
   these values and let your function acquire the elements it needs.

   Assign the [fnc] property to your function. 

   If you want to pass in values, create an object with properties hosting
   the desired values and assign that object to the [options] property.
   Your function can access them as cond.options.propertyname.

See \jTAC\Conditions\Base.js for an overview of Conditions.

Properties introduced by this class:
   fnc (function) -
      Reference to the function that is evaluated.
      You can pass a string name of the function so long
      as that function is defined on the window object.

   options (object) -
      An option where you can define property names 
      and values for those properties. This object is passed along
      with the condition object passed to your function giving
      you a way to pass along data that your function can use.
      One way to assign it is to use javascript's object notation:

      cond.options = {propertyName: value, propertyName2: value};

Module: Connection objects
Class : Connections.Value
Extends: Connections.Base

Purpose:
For holding a value in a property of this object.
Store the value in its value property.

If the type is something other than a string, identify the typeName that
makes typeSupported() return true. The typeName can be defined in
the [supportedTypeName] property or determined when the value property is set.
For numbers, its better to specify "integer" or "float" in [supportedTypeName] because
setvalue always treats a number type as "integer".

See \jTAC\Connections\Base.js for an overview of Connections.

Properties introduced by this class:
   value - The actual value stored.

   nullValue - Determines a value that means null. Used by isNullValue to
      compare the value property to this property.
      It defaults to null.

   supportedTypeName (string) - 
      The type name that makes the typeSupported() function return true.
      It is set whenever you set the [value] property, so long as the
      value is a number, string, or boolean. You must set it 
      explicitly for any other type or if your number is a float.

Module: Extending jquery-validate with support for Conditions.

Purpose:
Extend the prototypes for each Condition class to support features
used by validation. Includes:
- defining rule names that map to the condition
- default error message
- lookupKey property to get an error message from jTAC.translations
- token replacement function
- dependency support: the 'depend' property

This code works without jquery-validate present. It can be used
to setup alternative validation frameworks.

RULE NAMING
By default, a lowercase version of the condition name (without namespace) 
is used as the rule name. For example, "comparetovalue", "difference",
and "datatypecheck".
Conditions.Range and Conditions.Required conflict with native rule names.
Overwriting the native rules breaks due to some dependencies built into 
jquery-validate that assume you are still using the native rules.

As a result, Range and Required have these as rule names:
"advrange"
"advrequired"


TOKEN REPLACEMENT
Each Condition provides the replaceToken() method to replace tokens found
in the error message string
jTAC handles tokens in error messages through the jTAC.jqueryValidate.replaceTokens function.
That function calls the replaceToken function added to each Condition class
in the code that follows.
If jquery-validate lacks the validate option "replaceTokens",
expand it to support that feature.


DEPENDENCY SUPPORT
jquery-validate offers the depends parameter to specify 
a rule that enables the validation. This feature has two limitations
that are overcome by the enhancements below:
1. unobtrusive validation has no way to set this up
2. The user has to define a function calling jTAC.isValid()
   with the depends parameter. This could be simplified.

With these extensions all Conditions now have a "depends" property.
If assigned, it hosts a Condition that determines if the validation runs.
The Conditions.Base.canEvaluate() method has been replaced
to run that Condition and stop validation if it returns "failed".
(Both "success" and "cannot evaluate" proceed with validation.)

The "depends" property can also host a jquery selector. If that selector
finds at least one item, the condition is enabled.

The setup for the "depends" property is identical for both
coded and unobtrusive validation. You always define
an object with the properties of the Condition to be defined.
One of those properties can be "depends" and host another
object that defines the condition.
That object must include a 'jtacClass' property and specify
the name of a Condition object to create. 
The remaining properties assign their values to identical
property names on the Condition that is created.
Always specify the elementId property in the dependency condition.



Requires: 
ALWAYS LOAD jTAC.js BEFORE THIS FILE IS LOADED
ALWAYS LOAD any Condition scripts BEFORE THIS FILE IS LOADED

-------------------------------------------------------------
Module: Extending jquery-validate with support for Conditions.

Purpose:
Add and replace rules within jquery-validate, using the Condition
objects defined within jTAC.

Every Condition class that defined within the jTAC global will
become a rule in jquery-validate. The rule name will be a lowercase 
version of the class name of the Condition.

It also supports unobtrusive validation when jquery-validate-unobtrusive.js is loaded.

Each rule in jquery-validate has optional parameters, which are 
designed to tell the rule how to behave. For example, a range rule
needs a value for minimum and maximum.

jTAC always has you define a javascript object to customize its rules.
The object's properties are assigned to properties on the actual Condition object.
For example, when using the Conditions.Range class, this defines
its minimum and maximum property values:
{minimum: [value], maximum: [value]}

Example:
$("DateTextBox1").rules("add", {
  required: true,
  datatypecheck : { "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "Date" } }
  range : { "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "Date" }, 
                 "minimum" : "2012-01-01", 
                 "maximum" : "2012-12-31" }
});


When using unobtrusive validation, the javascript object should 
be defined in JSon format and appear in an attribute with this pattern:
data-val-rulename-json="{'property':value, 'property2':value}"

Example:
<input type='text' id='textbox1' name='textbox1'
   data-val="true"
   data-val-required=""
   data-val-datatypecheck=""
   data-val-datatypecheck-json="{'datatype': 'Date'}"
   data-val-range=""
   data-val-range-json="{'minimum': '2012-01-01', 'maximum': '2012-12-31'}" />

Rules for the syntax of the parameters object
---------------------------------------------
1) Parameter names require a case sensitive match to the actual property name
   on the Condition object. When using JSON, enclose the name in quotes.

2) String values representing numbers, dates, and times should always be 
   in a culture neutral format.
   Integers - digits only plus optional lead minus character. 
         Valid: 1000   -1000
         Invalid: 1,000   1000.0   1000-
   Float - digits and optionally a period followed by at least one more digit.
      Optional lead minus character.
         Valid: 1000   -1000   1000.0  -1000.0  1.23400
         Invalid: 1,000   1,000.0  1000.   1000.0-
   Currency and Percent : Same as Float
   Date - yyyy-MM-dd
         Valid: 2012-01-31
         Invalid: 01/31/2012
   Time - HH:mm:ss  uses 24 hour format 00-24. Always includes seconds.
         Valid: 14:00:00  00:00:00
         Invalid: 09:00:00 AM     09:00
   DateTime - yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
         Combines date and time with a space separator.

3) Conditions that use a TypeManager have several ways to define the TypeManager. 
   - The recommended approach is to add the [data-jtac-datatype] attribute to
      the element's markup. Assign its value to one of the TypeManager class names or aliases.

   - Use the "datatype" property as parameter, with the TypeManager class name or alias.
     datatypecheck : { "datatype" : "Date" }

   - Use the "typeManager" property as a parameter when you want to create a typeManager object with optional
     properties to customize it.
     datatypecheck : { "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "TypeManagers.Date" } }
     datatypecheck : { "typeManager" : { "jtacClass" : "Date", "dateFormat" : "1", fallbackDateFormats="[0, 10]" } }

   - If nothing else defines the TypeManager, it will use the TypeManagers.Integer class.

4) When writing javascript code to create the parameters, you don't need true Javascript Object Notation. 
   Ordinary objects will do. (When embedding parameters in an HTML tag's data property, you must use JSon.)
   When you do this, you can replace parameter values with javascript code that creates objects.
   In this example, typeManager is created from jTAC.create()
   and minimum/maximum use a Date object.

   $("DateTextBox1").rules("add", {
     required: true,
     datatypecheckcondition : { typeManager : jTAC.create("Date") }
     rangecondition : { typeManager : jTAC.create("Date"), 
                    minimum : new Date(2012, 0, 1), 
                    maximum : new Date(2012, 11, 31) }
   });

5) Do not specify the [elementId] property found on Conditions.
   The [elementId] is assigned automatically for you based on the id
   of the element being validated.
